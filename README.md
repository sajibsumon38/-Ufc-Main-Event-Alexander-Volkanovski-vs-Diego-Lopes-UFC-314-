Date: April 12, 2025Location: Kaseya Center — Miami Image Credit: UFC The bout is for the vacant UFC featherweight championship after Ilia Topuria vacated his strap to campaign at lightweight. This fight is important for both fighters because Volkanovski is trying to reclaim all his previous glory while Lopes is attempting to get his first UFC championship.
Alexander Volkanovski's
Record and Recent Form: Volkanovski (26-4) is a former UFC featherweight champion who held the belt for more than four years and defended it five times. But he also is coming off consecutive knockout defeats — first against Islam Makhachev in October 2023 at lightweight, and most recently against Ilia Topuria in February 2024 at featherweight. It will be his first fight in more than a year after a 14-month layoff.
Motivation: Volkanovski, 36, has admitted that this may be his final opportunity to reclaim the belt. He has adopted an “Old Man Volk” persona, seeking to demonstrate he still has the goods to compete in the fire of his years. He retains the confidence that his experience and tactical nous will enable him to outlast younger foes.
Diego Lopes' Rise
Record and Momentum: Lopes (26-6) has won five straight fights, including a win over Dan Ige and a victory over Brian Ortega. Lopes is known for an attacking style and knockout power, and has quickly closed the gap from debuting in the UFC less than two years ago to featherweight contender.
Fighting Style: An explosive striker with elite-level jiu-jitsu prowess (especially from the guard), Lopes is equally dangerous on the feet as he is on the ground. However, scrutiny over his cardio has remained, although he demonstrated progress in his last few fights.
Victory
For Volkanovski: Some experts say that Volkanovski must play his footwork and strategy game, and attack Lopes cardio to wear him out. Volkanovski needs to be cautious and stay away from early exchanges, where Lopes is most dangerous, as he has taken abuse in back-to-back knockout defeats.
For Lopes: Lopes will need to take advantage of Volkanovski’s recent struggles by pressing early and using his power. His knack for blending striking and grappling could also make things difficult for Volkanovski.
